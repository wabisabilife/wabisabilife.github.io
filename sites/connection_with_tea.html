                <div class="white_dot"></div>
                <p>In order to investigate the origin of the word wabi,
                    we must go into the world of tea.  The Japanese tea
                    ceremony involves the ritual preparation, serving, and drinking of green tea,
                    where is used green tea powder or matcha that is today associated with the tea ceremony,
                    and it appeared in Japan only in 1191. The monk Myōan Eisai, who is considered the founder
                    of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism in Japan, brought it from China during the reign of the
                    Song dynasty.  Tea seeds were planted in three places, among others in Uji near Kyoto,
                    which will remain the world's top tea producer for centuries.  Zen and the ideal of
                    tea spread rapidly during this period.</p></div>

                <h2>NARA PERIOD IN JAPAN</h2>
                <p>During the Nara period (Japan 710-794) tea plants were grown in Japan and mainly
                    consumed by priests and noblemen as medicine. Toward the end of the Tang dynasty in China,
                    the drinking of tea was going through a transformation from medicine to beverage,
                    but due to deteriorating relations between the two countries this transformation did not
                    reach Japan till much later. The Japanese were forced to mold and cultivate their own
                    traditions and culture  around the tea. Tea was a rare and valuable commodity from the Nara
                    period to the Heian period (794-1192) so rules and formalities were based on this concept.

                </h2>
                <p> In 1187 Myoan Eisai, a Japanese priest, traveled to China to study philosophy and religion.
                    When he came back, he became the founder of Zen Buddhism and b uild the first temple of the Rinzai sect.
                    It is said that he was the first one to cultivate tea for religious purposes,
                    unlike others before him who grew tea for medicinal use only.
                    He was also the first to suggest and teach the grinding of tea leaves before adding hot water.  </p>

                <h2> THIRTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SAMURAI </h2>
                <p> Tea started to spread outside of the Uji district where it had mainly been grown since the beginning.
                    But by now popularity and so demand was growing rapidly and called for plantations all around Japan.
                    The samurai class, who loved everything about the Sung dynasty including the Tea ceremony,
                    embraced it wholly and caused even greater popularity of the ritual preparation of green tea.
                    Many of them accepted Zen-Buddhism, especially because of its attention towards discipline and meditation. In many of the prominent temples of Kyoto city were so called karesansui or japanese dry gardens or zen gardens, which reflect the core of nature and encourage great contemplation.  </p>

                <h2> 15TH CENTURY </h2>
                <p> Back in the 15th century, the monk and tea ceremony master Murata Shuko recognized that
                    the act of preparing and drinking tea could reflect Zen principles, and is therefore credited
                    with a fundamental role in the development of the tea ceremony.  Shogun Yoshimasa,
                    an advocate of cultural leisure, ordered a special tea ceremony from Shukō for himself,
                    and Shukō used the occasion to discover an even deeper level of the tea ceremony.
                    In his influential essay "The Book of Tea", Okakura Kazuko says that Japan will soon turn
                    the cult of "drinking tea" into a "religion of aestheticism based on the worship of the beautiful
                    among the banal facts of everyday existence"  </p>

                <h2> SIMPLICITY AS AN AESTHETIC IDEAL – SEN NO RIKYŪ </h2>
                <p> By the second half of the 16th century, the tea ceremony became an important social event and an
                    opportunity for wealthy people to show off their wealth.  Hideyoshi filled his luxurious tea room,
                    completely covered in gold, with expensive accessories, mostly imported from China.
                    At the same time, his master of the tea ceremony, Sen no Rikyū, quietly started a revolution by
                    significantly reducing the size of the tea room in order to change the fundamental principles of
                    aesthetic ideals.  He removed everything superfluous and kept only the necessary:
                    a place for gathering, a greeting to nature, a teapot and basic utensils - and time for tea.
                    The small windows almost completely dimmed the light so that the guests would have a
                    stronger experience with other senses. Barely larger than three square meters,
                    Sen no Rikyu's intimate tea room was half the size of traditional tea rooms. </p>

                    Located at Myoki-an temple in Yamazaki, Kyoto, it was constructed in 1582 and it represents the concept
                    of wabi-cha. As a National Treasure of Japan, Tai-an is a small chashitsu: it comprises two tatami mats. </p>
