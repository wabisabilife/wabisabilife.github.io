                <p class="fader">Wabi-sabi encourages people to have a more laid-back approach to happiness and success by finding beauty in
                    simplicity and flaws. The aesthetic value promotes a laid-back society with a strong cultural regard for
                    cyclicality and unpredictability in nature. Nothing is ever truly finished; everything is always shifting,
                    rising, and falling. We shall start and end with nothing, much like our own lives, and wabi-sabi promotes
                    this idea in all facets of non-living portions of society as well. Things would be made from sustainable
                    resources, and respect for the natural world and the environment would permeate every aspect of society.

                    Materials would be used to their greatest potential and held in the highest regard for their usefulness.
                    Products would be made to return to the emptiness from which they came. Handmade things for individual
                    consumers would be manufactured from materials that are disposable and naturally decomposers.
                    Since they wouldn't be as required, vehicles and equipment that harm the environment would not be as prominent.
                    As people would no longer be so concerned with micromanaging time,
                    there would be a larger emphasis on the now than the future, and time would be more cyclical than linear.</p>
