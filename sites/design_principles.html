                <p class="fader">The elements that make up this type of design are: rough finish, simplicity and minimalism,
                    asymmetry, imbalance, flat and neutral colors, textures, organic influences,
                    disharmony. Designers who inject a bit of wabi-sabi into their design give it more life,
                    even though we're talking about digital media.
                    Wabi-sabi beauty provides a visual balance to projects because it is basically the
                    opposite of a design style based on a polished digital screen.

            </figure>

            <p class="fader">It is impossible to create a spectrum of all the elements of wabi-sabi. The spectrums provide a further breakdown of qualities that commonly characterize wabi-sabi and are open to subjective interpretation. A dynamic continuum better conveys the qualities of the aesthetic than a static rubric that either supports or contradicts wabi-sabi.</p>

                <h2>Color</h2>
                <p>
                    On the left you can see personally chosen colors that have been set as an example, taken from various studies of color palettes that show up on the web related to wabi sabi. Color schemes are inspired by nature.

                    <br><br> Brown, black, gray, earth green and rustic-like are common color palettes. Instead of the living color, muted colors are used. Cool, soothing hues drawn from the world around us give a design a peaceful feel.

                <h2>Sustainability</h2>
                <p>
                    To limit environmental waste, recyclable, natural, and reused materials are employed. Every material has the capacity to dissolve into nothingness.

                    <br><br>The philosophy behind it is that what has lost its original shine and quality due to the influence of time does not mean it must necessarily become waste and something that will clutter up our cupboards and drawers.
                    The beauty lies precisely in a type of material that is outdated, rustic and can be used in something completely new.

                <h2>Production</h2>
                <p>
                    The production process involves no machines. Nature itself, handmade goods, and innovative concepts served as the means of manufacturing.

                    <br><br>That's why, in the tea ceremony, often used bowls are those which are shaped by the passage of time and are normally dull-colored and roughly finished, often unglazed at the base, and on the sides the glaze has usually been allowed to run-an original fortunate mistake which has been seen to offer endless opportunities for the "controlled accident."

                <h2>Time</h2>
                <p>Over time, everything ages and changes its original form.
                    Only its beauty has been enhanced by age. As time goes on, there is no progress or tangible improvement but these objects exhibit tenacity, insight, and resilience that have been acquired over time.
