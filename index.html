            <p class="fader">Wabi-sabi is rooted in aesthetics and nature of the Japanese.
                They experience it almost intuitively and it’s a term difficult to define to those who want to understand it without experiencing it.
                Nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect,
                which are the three basic realities that give wabi-sabi its authenticity.
                It's about discovering the beauty in nature's flaws and cycles of development, rot, and death.

                    <p class="fader">But first, lets see how the term Wabi-Sabi was coined.</p>
                    <p class="fader">Wabi-sabi originated from two separate words.
                        Both are imbued with aesthetic value, and their roots are in literature,
                        culture and religion. They are wabi - 侘 and sabi - 寂.

                <div>
                    <h2>WABI</h2>
                    <p class="fader">The word "wabi" derives from the root wa, which stands for balance, tranquility, harmony, and serenity. Wabi originally meant melancholy, loneliness, and sadness, but it has grown to imply straightforwardness, materialistic-freedoom, humbleness by choice, and in one with nature. It's a transcendental beauty made possible by a tiny flaw.
                        The original meaning of the word had to do with poverty, insufficiency and despair, from the word wabiru, as in worry or yearn, and the related adjective wabishii, as in miserable, lonely, poor. It is sublime beauty in the cruel reality of life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fader">As the Buddhist priest Kenko wrote seven centuries ago: "Should we look at spring flowers only when they are in full bloom, and the moon when the sky is clear and cloudless?" </p>
                    <p class="fader">Beauty is not visible only in what is joyful, loud or obvious.</p>

                    <h2>SABI</h2>
                    <p class="fader">Sabi conveys the deep and peaceful beauty that emerges with the passage of time.
                        Visually we recognize it as something that has darkened and lost its luster and has signs of
                        antiquity, but its meaning goes much deeper. This special beauty respects the natural cycle of life,
                        reflects it and reminds us of it, and stimulates a multitude of emotional reactions,
                        from nostalgia and melancholy to thoughtfulness and longing.</p>
                    <p class="fader">
                        The adjective sabishii means lonely, solitary.
                        The essence of sabi permeates many lines of haiku poetry written by Matsuo Bashō
                        in the 17th century, which are still loved around the world for their timeless beauty.
                        There is also a verb, sabiru - with a different logogram, but the same pronunciation.
                        It means to rust, decay or show signs of age and has another layer of meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fader">The beauty of the saber reminds us of our connection with the past,
                        the natural cycle of life and our own mortality.
